In reality, children (students) are transported to school via bus, car with parent(s), bike, walk, etc.
To begin this project is to create a website that branches in site-to-site that connects through links, tunneling/funneling to master branch (School) collaberatiom
that illiminates the frustrational chaos of multiple pages...
Example (chaos);
Google Share to Classroom (extension), gives option sign in or create. As sign in to connected classroom with link connecting to teacher along with the link that connects to the class.
From class is simple format that has a calendar type layout with the assignment and or tasks that need to be completed, looking up in the search and pages already open, there total of 3 or 4 opem pages depending on how many links clicked to get to weekly datasheet.
Brainstorming ideas to simnplify the example (chaos);
* illiminate the multiple links that open topics directed within one main page, including site-to-site to connect within main school page.
